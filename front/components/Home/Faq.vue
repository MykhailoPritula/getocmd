            <p>Rejuvenation Complex Cream was formulated to work with your current skincare routine to help you support tight, glowing skin. It is so effective, many ladies end up not needing other products. We do recommend that you allow at least 15 minutes before applying makeup after applying Rejuvenation Complex Cream. This allows your skin to fully absorb the skin-replenishing nutrients and moisturizers.</p>
